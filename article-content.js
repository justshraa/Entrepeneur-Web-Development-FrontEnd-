The new location is at the Grand Conference Center, Room A. Please make sure to update your calendar with the new venue details. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. These processes include learning, which is the acquisition of information and rules for using the information, reasoning, which involves using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions, and self-correction. AI is broadly classified into three types: Narrow AI, General AI, and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, is designed and trained for specific tasks, such as virtual personal assistants like Siri and Alexa. General AI, or Strong AI, possesses generalized human cognitive abilities and can find solutions to unfamiliar tasks without human intervention. Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) surpasses human intelligence and can perform any task better than a human. AI has a wide range of applications across various industries. In healthcare, AI is utilized for diagnostic purposes, personalized treatment plans, drug discovery, and patient monitoring. In finance, AI aids in fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and providing personalized financial advice. In the retail sector, AI enhances customer experiences through personalized recommendations, inventory management, and optimizing supply chains.

Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, is designed and trained for specific tasks, such as virtual personal assistants like Siri and Alexa. General AI, or Strong AI, possesses generalized human cognitive abilities and can find solutions to unfamiliar tasks without human intervention. Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) surpasses human intelligence and can perform any task better than a human. AI has a wide range of applications across various industries. In healthcare, AI is utilized for diagnostic purposes, personalized treatment plans, drug discovery, and patient monitoring. In finance, AI aids in fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and providing personalized financial advice. In the retail sector, AI enhances customer experiences through personalized recommendations, inventory management, and optimizing supply chains.
